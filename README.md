# KATranslationTools
Utility scripts for translating Khan Academy

## How to install

In Chrome/Chromium

* Install [Tampermonkey user script manager](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo). If link does not work, search for "Tapermonkey" in the [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore)
* Open [this link](https://github.com/ulikoehler/KATranslationTools/raw/master/KATranslationTools.user.js)
* You should see the Tampermonkey page with a green bar at the top (else, Tampermonkey has not been installed correctly)
* Click on "Install" button (located in the upper left)

For Firefox you can use [Greasmonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) which should work in a similar way but I ([ulikoehler](https://github.com/ulikoehler)) haven't tested this method yet.

## How to use

*Note:* Currently the script primarily contains german translation code

Go to either [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/khanacademy/de) or the [KA translation dashboard](https://www.khanacademy.org/translations/de/) for your language and navigate the site until you can see a string and its translation.
